# TektronixAFG3K

An EPICS StreamDevice IOC application for driving Tektronix 3000 series arbitrary function generators.
It was developed with the [programmer's manual](https://download.tek.com/manual/AFG3000-Series-Arbitrary-Function-Generator-Programmer-EN.pdf), and tested with a Tektronix AFG3011 at the SST beamline.

Included Phoebus `*.bob` files were generated automatically with the help of the [epicsdb2bob utility](https://github.com/NSLS2/epicsdb2bob).
